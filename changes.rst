Changes
=======

0.3.2 (01/23/2018)
------------------
- Fix issue #24 to provide compatibility with networkx 2.0. Earlier versions of networkx are no longer supported.

0.3.1 (06/07/2016)
------------------
- Give experimentator a `DOI <https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/22554/hsharrison/experimentator>`_.


0.3.0 (08/25/2015)
------------------
- Change the save format from pickle to YAML. This allows experiment changes to be diffed.
- Unify run callbacks and context managers. Now |Experiment.add_callback| takes an optional argument ``is_context`` to differentiate the two.

0.2.5 (05/23/2015)
------------------
- Fix bug that occurred when using |Sorted| caused by conditions being a generator object.

------------------

- Add |ExperimentSection.description| property.
- Reduce number of debug messages when running sections.
- Fix bug where parent sections would be marked as having started after running demo trials.
- Workaround for pandas bug (issue 7380) where comparing two different DataFrames would raise an exception instead of returning ``False``.
- Comparing any of experimentator's objects to a different type now returns ``False``.
